## Inspiration
Drama on the Internet. In popular social media sites like Twitter and YouTube, it is hard not to come across mean comments. One negative comment can lead to a recipe for disaster. It "encourages" other users to pick a side and "fight". 

While some of the "drama" ends in peace. Others choose to exchange offensive language and negative remarks on one another. More often than not, the root of these arguments stems from misunderstandings. It could be due to cultural differences or different upbringing. Some might even think their comment is "not an issue", or it's a trivial matter. 

Regardless of which side you are on, the wrong tone in your message just adds fuel to fire. As we get absorbed into this behaviour, our body and mind can begin to collapse. Emotionally, we do not feel good. Some might feel betrayed, injustice or unfair. As time passes, things that happen online might translate to the real world. 

With this in mind, we hope to tackle the root cause of this pressing issue. And that is communication.

## What it does
**itrymybest** hopes to help users take a step back and think before sending out that potentially harmful comment. 

Using **itrymybest** is very easy. The user inserts their unsent message into the textbox and hits send. Almost instantly, an analysis of their message appears. In this analysis, we focus on the **tone** and **offensiveness** of the message. 

For **tone**, our app picks the highest-scoring emotion out of the 5 - 'Angry', 'Fear', 'Happy', 'Sad' and 'Surprise. This gives the user a suggestion on how their message can be perceived by others. 

For **offensiveness**, our app scans for things such as swear words and slurs. It takes a step forward and gives a detailed explanation of what the word means. Sometimes, a certain word might not be what we thought it would be. With this function, users get to learn the meaning of the word and understand why it might be offensive to some. 

**itrymybest** hopes to promote critical thinking. Allowing users to analyze and see if their comment is constructive or just plain rude.

"Think before you act", by fostering critical thinking skills, the Internet can be fun and engaging.
